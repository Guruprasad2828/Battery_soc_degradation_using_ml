This code is designed to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries using various forecasting models based on historical data. The prediction is based on input data from battery performance logs, which includes parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and capacity degradation over time. The model forecasts the future degradation of the battery and estimates how long the battery will continue to function efficiently before it needs replacement.

Key Objectives of the Code:

Train a predictive model to forecast RUL based on battery degradation data.
Evaluate different forecasting methods, including statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.
Provide accurate RUL predictions for battery management systems (BMS), including SOC (State of Charge) and SOH (State of Health) monitoring.

Data Preprocessing:

Input Data: The input consists of battery data, including performance metrics like voltage, current, temperature, and capacity over time. The data is typically provided as a CSV file or in a similar format.
Data Cleaning: Missing values, outliers, or invalid data points are handled through imputation, interpolation, or removal.
Feature Engineering: The code processes and extracts relevant features that can be used to predict battery degradation, including time-series features, degradation rate, and statistical summary metrics.

Modeling:

The code supports several different forecasting models that can be used to predict the remaining useful life of a battery, including:

  Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and other regression models for predicting RUL.
  Deep Learning Models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to handle sequential time-series data.
  
The models are trained using historical data and their hyperparameters are optimized to minimize prediction errors. For deep learning models, training involves learning the patterns of battery degradation over time.


Prediction:

Once trained, the models are used to predict the RUL of batteries in the test set.
The prediction gives the estimated remaining life of the battery in terms of time or cycles until the battery reaches an inefficient or unusable state.

Evaluation:

The code includes functions to evaluate the performance of the models using standard error metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.

Visualization:

The code provides visualizations to help understand model performance and battery degradation trends. These include:
Predicted vs Actual RUL plots: Helps visualize how well the model's predictions align with the actual remaining useful life of the battery.
Degradation Curves: Show the battery's performance degradation over time and how the prediction is made based on the current state of the battery.
