Battery degradation involves the decline in performance and capacity over time, influenced by factors like charge cycles and temperature. Machine learning methods analyze data from usage patterns to predict degradation and estimate remaining useful life. This enables better maintenance strategies and enhances battery longevity.
I have used nasa data set here which is a widely used data set for battery degradation and research purpose
